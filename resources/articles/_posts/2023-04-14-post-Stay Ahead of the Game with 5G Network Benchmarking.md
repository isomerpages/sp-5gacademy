The importance of performing 5G network benchmarking in today's highly competitive telecommunications industry cannot be emphasized enough. Benchmarking is the game changer that allows you to stay ahead of the curve and provide unparalleled service to your customers. By testing and measuring network performance against your competitors, you gain a competitive edge that cannot be matched. 

Benchmarking data is a powerful tool that can be used to make informed decisions about network investments. With access to accurate and comprehensive data on key performance indicators (KPIs), you can focus on implementing network improvements in a way that enhances the quality of service for end-customers and helps to reduce customer churn. 

Imagine having real-time insight into your network's performance, enabling you to identify and resolve issues before they impact your customers. By utilizing benchmarking data, you can optimize your network's capacity, coverage, and reliability, providing a seamless end-user experience.

Benchmarking data can also be used for marketing – find out the strengths of your network against competitors and use them in advertising and promotion. With actual data to back up your marketing claims, you gain a competitive edge and position your network as best-in-class in the minds of the customers. 

However, to achieve the highest quality data and a comprehensive understanding of your network's competitive landscape, benchmarking campaigns must be carefully planned. This includes drive and walk tests that cover all necessary locations and collect all important KPIs while using the same mobile devices as your customers are using. The data collection process is further complicated by the need to collect data from multiple competitive networks, making planning and execution even more crucial.

**Scalability and Flexibility at the Core of Nemo Benchmarking Solutions**

Data collection equipment are typically long-term investments. To back up your investment, Keysight’s Nemo benchmarking tools have been designed to adapt to different network measurement needs mobile operators might have today and in the future. 

A modular, scalable, and comprehensive benchmarking system may sound complex, but it does not have to be so. At the core of Keysight’s laptop-based Nemo benchmarking systems is the powerful Nemo Outdoor engine that has an established position both as a pioneer and leader in drive test measurement solutions for over 25 years. Nemo Outdoor is not only widely used, but also known for its ease of use and flexible user interface. A short learning curve and a single, easy-to-use platform for all network measurement needs contribute to lower operating costs and lower initial investment as it can be taken into use effectively with less training. 

In the past few years, Keysight has introduced two Nemo Outdoor based benchmarking solutions, both designed while keeping the requirements of 5G network testing in mind. Now that they have been on the market for a while, they have been thoroughly tested, verified, and well received by our customers.  Nemo Network Benchmarking Solution (NBM) is a scalable measurement solution for network benchmarking, optimization, and verification for field and lab environments. Nemo Backpack Pro is a lightweight benchmarking solution suitable for both walk testing and drive testing.
