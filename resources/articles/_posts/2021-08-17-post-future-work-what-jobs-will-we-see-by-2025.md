THE STRAITS TIMES - Tech skills, the human touch and data analysis will drive the jobs of the future.

Those are the sentiments of major employers and recruitment firms The Straits Times spoke to.

Old roles are evolving. Whether you are a nurse or a factory assembly-line worker, be prepared for data analysis to play a role, experts say.

Banks, financial services and medical operators will be hiring cyber-security specialists, while real estate bosses will seek sustainability experts.

At the same time, front-facing roles will become even more important as sales and service staff have to adapt to changing consumer needs.

These changes are fashioned by increasing digitalisation, greater focus on the environment and trends fuelled by the pandemic such as remote working.
Mr Ari Sarker, co-president, Asia-Pacific, at global payment service provider Mastercard, says tech jobs have to be redefined.

"At this point, business and technology are no longer siloed. The future of tech jobs will be a blend of business savvy and technical expertise."

More tech jobs requiring the human touch will emerge by 2025, according to the 2020 Future Of Jobs report by the World Economic Forum.

Ms Linda Teo, country manager of global workforce solutions company ManpowerGroup Singapore, notes: "As technology becomes more prevalent, we will also see more jobs requiring human interaction emerge as human ingenuity and judgment are qualities that are needed to augment technology.

"They include jobs in the care economy, sales and marketing and in roles that focus on people and culture."

Here are five trends shaping the jobs of the future.

# 1. AI and automation
Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in both the manufacturing and services industries to take over repetitive tasks, in order to reduce error from human fatigue and improve business outcomes.

Mr Ng Tian Chong, managing director, Greater Asia, at HP, says the technology company's factory in Singapore has moved from manual, labour-intensive production to AI-driven automation. It improved productivity by 70 per cent through new technology such as robotics, 3D printing and analytics.

As factory jobs move away from manual labour towards roles with tech skills, and as smart factories with automation replace old production systems, employees in production must be skilled in big data and robotics.

Mr Ng says: "A lot of production jobs can be done with automation, but who looks after the robots? There are new jobs showing up, but more importantly, existing roles will carry on. We have to adjust, modify and augment some of these existing roles in the light of new technology."

Similarly, in healthcare, AI is used to automate some laboratory tests or analyse data from health devices.

Ms Siow Ai Li, managing director of med-tech company Siemens Healthineers, Singapore, says: "We now have more than 65 AI-based products and applications in the global market that further increase our customers' productivity, as well as enable more precise and tailored clinical decisions."

The company, she adds, recently launched a new AI-powered application for radiologists in Singapore, which "helps take away the burden of repetitive tasks and enables them to improve diagnostic precision when interpreting medical images".

Dr Prem Kumar Nair, chief executive officer of private healthcare group IHH Healthcare Singapore, says automated analysers and results reporting "allow valuable resources such as medical technologists to focus on more value-added work".

He adds: "By adopting AI tools, automation and other technologies, we are able to raise productivity and work efficiency in the wards."

In the travel and tourism sector, technology such as AI, big data, robotics and augmented reality (AR) are already being applied.

Ms Chew Chien Way, director of human resources and organisation development at Singapore Tourism Board (STB), says: "We see robots deployed at our airport, virtual concierges that provide personalised recommendations, and tours that deploy AR or virtual reality.

"These may require new roles such as experience designers and data analysts or cross-training staff in new areas - without neglecting the human element that makes hospitality special."

# 2. Digitalisation
The Covid-19 pandemic pushed businesses and consumers online.

Mr Ben King, country director of Google Singapore, says: "Even in Singapore, where we see high digital connectivity, there has been continued growth in the adoption of digital services, with almost a third of all digital service users being first-timers in 2020 and more than nine in 10 intending to continue their usage after the pandemic."

As employees shifted to remote working, demand grew for online tools such as data storage and shared computing resources.

Mr Richard Koh, chief technology officer at Microsoft Singapore, notes that demand for cloud services has thus increased, but warns about the risks.

"Knowledge gaps are the biggest risk to cloud adoption and, if not properly addressed, could hamper or even derail an organisation's digital transformation in the long run," he adds.

"For successful cloud adoption, organisations need to first align solutions to their business needs and, very importantly, upskill their talent in cloud technologies."

Because the online economy generates large volumes of data about consumers that have to be stored, managed and protected, experts in data protection, data privacy and cyber security are sought after.

The online economy has also generated new business opportunities for financial services and payment firms, says Mastercard's Mr Sarker.

As the company supports business-to-business trade flows, notably among small and medium enterprises, it requires specialists with tech expertise and business savvy.

"We also anticipate the need for solution architects and real-time payment specialists to accelerate our diversification and services strategy," he says.

# 3. Demographic shifts
As more consumers work and shop online, the way people use space is changing.

Businesses might want to reduce their office space or workers might need more flexible and shared work spaces. Malls will see less physical footfall among retail tenants.

These trends are prompting a rethink in the real estate industry.

Mr Chia Khong Shoong, group chief corporate officer of Frasers Property, says: "How do you reshape malls and make them a place where people want to go, when they are staying home and shopping online?"

To address this, the company, which runs 14 malls here, has introduced online incentives to drive business to retailers, such as making takeaway easier through the Makan Master feature on the Frasers Experience app and optimising physical space so delivery riders can easily pick up orders.

Mr Chia says the industry needs people with design thinking skills, who can understand the needs of shifting demographics and help optimise and curate space.

To make spaces more attractive and accessible, Frasers Property launched the Inclusive Spaces programme in 2019, which partnered tertiary students with people with disabilities to co-design solutions in order to improve the accessibility of its malls.

"A lot of our malls are in the suburbs and occupy a prominent position in the community they serve. We think it's important they are accessible to different classes of people," he says.

# 4. The human touch
High-touch services such as healthcare and personalised interaction in hospitality and dining will remain important and require employees with new skill sets.

Dr Nair of IHH Healthcare says: "While there has been much discussion about technology and digitisation taking over many roles in healthcare, medical treatment is still very much high-touch and hands-on in nature, meaning it will remain human-intensive in the front-line clinical areas.

"Demand for clinical staff - doctors, allied healthcare professionals and especially nurses - will only continue to increase."

However, nurses and allied healthcare professionals will use more digital tools. "Our nurses of tomorrow will require additional skill sets to stay effective in their roles," Dr Nair says.

The pandemic, STB's Ms Chew notes, has sharpened the focus on health and personal well-being, and Singapore aims to be a leading urban wellness haven.

"To get there, we need a wide range of roles and capabilities - including trainers, practitioners and relevant hospitality personnel - to provide wide-ranging and personalised wellness services for both travellers and locals."

Similarly, Mr Benjamin Boh, general manager of McDonald's Singapore, says that while digitisation and online ordering may increase, front-facing roles remain key to ensure "hospitality, care and connection with customers".

# 5. Sustainability
Sustainability and ESG (environment and social governance) are key players in all sectors.

Companies are increasingly committed to lowering their carbon footprint to net zero within a decade or more, while a growing number of consumers have become more conscious of their impact on the environment.

Ms Esther An, chief sustainability officer of City Developments, says a new team was formed last year to drive sustainable tech solutions across the business.

The real estate developer carried out a study with several hundred internal and external stakeholders last year and found that ESG and carbon footprint were important when they considered investments.

Ms An sees growth in jobs related to products and solutions in decarbonisation and relevant technology.

The sector will need specialists who can help develop and operate buildings that are manpower- efficient, low-carbon and easy to maintain, use less energy and appeal to end users and customers.

Traditional roles in construction and facilities management are being augmented by technology and sustainable practices such as smart building systems that use sensors to check on temperature, lighting and footfall or drones to carry out remote inspections.

Like many employers seeking to hire talent in a new and rapidly growing field, Ms An knows that applicants may not come with the requisite specialisations.

Thus, she adds, "when we are hiring candidates, we look at skill sets as well as mindsets", and self-motivated candidates with a willingness to learn tend to stand out.

**The jobs of the future**

Whether new roles, or old roles reinvented, the jobs of the future require specialist skills.

**AI and automation experts**

Artificial intelligence (AI) experts will be needed to design automation for the future. More sectors are turning to AI and machine learning to do rote tasks, such as office administration or oversight of a production line.

Mr Richard Koh, chief technology officer of Microsoft Singapore, says there is a growing demand for deep tech and skilled professionals in the AI industry.

Even in healthcare, laboratory tests are being performed by automated analysers, freeing up medical technicians for other value-added work, says Dr Prem Kumar Nair, chief executive officer of IHH Healthcare Singapore.

**Cyber-security and data protection experts**

The pandemic has brought more businesses and organisations online, and also more consumers.

Mr Ben King, country director of Google Singapore, says that 30 per cent of all digital service users were first-timers last year.

There is rising demand for specialists who can protect confidential information about companies or their customers. Specialists in data privacy laws will also be needed to guide company policies.

**Data analysts and data scientists**

Data scientists analyse large volumes of data to improve business outcomes. They are in demand in most sectors, including healthcare, manufacturing and real estate and in the financial services industry.

In healthcare, for example, large amounts of data are generated regularly, either from hospital-grade medical devices or health trackers worn by individuals. This data can be analysed to help improve healthcare outcomes for patients.

Similarly, data sent by sensors tracking the usage of a building or the performance of an automated factory assembly line can be analysed to improve the carbon footprint of a building or maximise the efficiency of production.

**High-touch roles in healthcare**

Demand for doctors, nurses and allied health professionals such as pharmacists, radiologists and physiotherapists is expected to remain strong. However, AI and tech tools will be developed to reduce human error due to fatigue and also to reduce the time such professionals spend on rote tasks.

**Hospitality professionals**

The human touch remains important in sectors such as tourism and dining.

Ms Chew Chien Way, director of human resources and organisation development at the Singapore Tourism Board, says Singapore aims to position itself as a haven for urban wellness.

This means increased demand for fitness and wellness coaches, as well as hospitality professionals, among others.

**Sustainability experts**

This is a growing theme across sectors.

As industries seek to reduce their carbon footprint, sustainability professionals will be required to define how this can be done and track whether or not projects are sustainable.

For example, green engineers are needed to find and implement tech solutions that reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of construction.

Sustainable financing experts will generate green bonds and green loans for projects that have low carbon footprints and market them to investors.

# The skills to build
The influential, not-for-profit organisation World Economic Forum estimated in October last year that 97 million new jobs may emerge by 2025.

While 85 million jobs will be lost to artificial intelligence (AI) and robots, there will be millions more created for the humans overseeing this advanced technology.

These new jobs will require about 50 per cent of the global workforce to reskill, according to the forum's Future of Jobs Report 2020.

The good news is that such reskilling will take at most six months, often less.

The forum's top skills for 2025 include analytical thinking and innovation; active learning and learning strategies; complex problem-solving; critical thinking and analysis and creativity, originality and initiative. Leadership skills, tech use and tech design are also on the list.

Employers that The Sunday Times spoke to also cited the need for critical thinking and analytical skills, along with specialist tech skills that can be acquired on the job or in short training courses.

Also important are soft skills - communication, collaboration, storytelling and people management to the extent of coaching and motivating employees.

Workers skilled in tech, finance, business and the intersection of these sectors are at a premium.

In Singapore, partnerships between the Government and tech companies such as Microsoft Singapore and Google Singapore aim to upskill citizens and permanent residents for tech jobs.

The skills shortage also provides growth opportunities for independent training providers.

Trainocate Singapore has trained 1,600 people in Singapore in tech courses relevant to Microsoft in the 2021 financial year and sees rising demand for courses in people management and time management.

The Center of Applied Data Science (Cads), an AI solutions company and consulting firm which operates across Asean, this month launched Project 2100, an initiative aiming to train 10 million data scientists in the region by 2025.

Among the core skills Cads offers to develop are data storytelling and data storylistening.

Data storytelling is key for analysts and helps them communicate their insights efficiently and effectively.

Ms Sharala Axryd, chief executive officer of Cads, says data storytelling is a core skill for managers and executives.

"Communicating with data is great, but being able to process data stories for guided decision-making is what all managers and leaders need.

"A data storylistener can spot errors that others can't see and can see through decision-making fallacies, biases in data and misuses of data," she says.

**What workers want**
Hybrid work arrangements, flexible hours and support for mental health are being prioritised by employees and job seekers amid lifestyle shifts fuelled by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Recruitment firms that The Sunday Times spoke to say that workers in Singapore are looking for more than essential benefits such as annual leave and medical coverage.

The Covid-19 pandemic has shown that remote working is a feasible arrangement, says Ms Linda Teo, country manager of ManpowerGroup Singapore, a global workforce solutions company.

More job seekers want the option to work from home, which can help to balance work and personal life.

However, she adds: "The extended period of working from home has further blurred the line dividing work and personal life, and many are feeling the strain. Plus, they are also suffering from digital overload due to the increased e-mails, online meetings and digital communications."

Microsoft compared trends in the use of its Microsoft 365 software between February last year and this year and found that time spent in Microsoft Teams meetings has more than doubled globally.

Teams users are also sending more chats, including 42 per cent more chats a person after office hours.

These results were released in April this year, as part of Microsoft's first Work Trend Index, a study of 30,000 people in 31 countries, including Singapore. The index also found that 54 per cent of employees feel overworked and 39 per cent are exhausted.

Job seekers are thus looking for companies which prioritise employee mental health and offer support for work-life balance, recruiters say.

They also prefer to join companies that are active in social causes and help the community, says Mr Foo See Yang, managing director and country head at workforce solutions firm PersolKelly Singapore, which operates across the Asia-Pacific.

He says that hiring for remote positions - which refers to virtual jobs usually done from home anywhere in the world, not in a traditional office - is on the rise, as the pandemic limits travel.

Still, job seekers prefer hybrid work - both working in the office as well as remotely - to fully remote positions. "More employees and job seekers recognise the importance of in-person interactions in cultivating a solid workplace," he says.

Professional development is also a big draw for job seekers, according to recruiters.

Ms Teo says: "Job seekers also want jobs that can help them gain exposure and learn new skills as more are aware of the need to build career security.

"To ensure they stay ahead of shifting skill demands, they want to be employed in jobs that challenge them and enable them to acquire skills that can help them stay gainfully employed or expand their career."<p></p>
