The Regional Industry Networking Conference (RINC) 2021, held on 17 Nov 2021 as a hybrid event, was a huge success. As with past RINC events, its objective was to provide a platform for local and regional participants to share and discuss industry trends and the latest developments and innovations in the various areas of engineering. RINC 2021 focussed on the theme, **5G and Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) for the Enterprises**, including how 5G & AIoT can be applied in the advanced manufacturing, smart estate/building as well as green and sustainable solutions to bring about industry and community transformation.  It included a learning journey to show participants the pervasive connectivity, architecture and technologies needed to deploy a large scale AIoT ecosystem sustainably. Various 5G & AIoT applications and use cases were also presented.  

Minister of Communications and Information (MCI), Ms Josephine Teo, was the Guest of Honour (GOH) for the launch of 5G & AIoT Centre and 5G Learning Journey at RINC 2021. Invited guests from MCI, IMDA, Singtel, Ericsson, NUS and SMEs also attended the event.
