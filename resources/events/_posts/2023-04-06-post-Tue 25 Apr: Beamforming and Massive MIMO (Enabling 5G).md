# About the Event

5G enables access to higher frequency spectrum than previous generations. In order to efficiently use that high frequency spectrum [and put very simply], antenna size needs to be smaller, and we need to use more of them. This in turn means that massive antenna arrays are a key component of 5G deployment - where lots of antennas are used in a very organised way to focus energy and drive spectral efficiency. The ways in which 5G data streams are mapped to those antenna arrays is highly flexible, offering the operator a range of beamforming and massive MIMO (Multiple-In, Multiple-Out) options. 

This talk explores the options and techniques available, as well as setting out the most appropriate deployment scenarios. We aim to make sense of this highly complex subject â€“ looking at the impact of advanced antenna systems without getting stuck into the mathematics!

**Topics to be discussed include:**

* Frequency Bands for 5G
* Propagation Characteristics - UHF to mmWave
* Frequency and Typical Cell Ranges
* Dual Connectivity
* Antenna Arrays
* MIMO Explained
* SU-MIMO
* MU-MIMO
* Massive MIMO Techniques
* Beamforming in 5G
* Advanced Antenna Techniques
* Use of Reference Signals and Feedback for Beam Management
* Advanced Antenna Use Cases
