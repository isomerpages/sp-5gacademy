# About the Event

The SUSS Analytics and Visualisation Challenge 2021 (AVC21) welcomes poster submissions from A'levels, International Baccalaureate, and Polytechnic Diploma students.

In this event, we will be exploring the challenges of our times. There will be two general themes:

1. Our Youths
2. The Covid-19 Pandemic.

Topics concerning the challenges faced by our youths may include the pressures and uncertainties they face, quarter life crisis, social media, etc. Topics concerning the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic may include work from home, home based learning, employment, social isolation, mental stress, etc. 

You may select a theme that you would like to submit your poster to. The content in your poster submissions may touch on both themes. If you are unsure about which theme to choose, just make a submission and we will help to assign your posters to the most appropriate category.
