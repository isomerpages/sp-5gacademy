# Learning Journey #4

## NYP-Starhub APEX 5G Centre Tour


5G is the latest generation of mobile technology, distinct from previous generations because it is not simply a step up from 4G in terms of speeds. It is software-based by nature and therefore more flexible than previous generations of cellular technology. Rather than one network that fits all, 5G will enable the use of different characteristics tailored to meet the requirements of specific applications. 5G is an enabling technology that is just on the cusp of reaching the mainstream. 

This talk provides fundamentals of the 5G technology and its features such as Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) and Network Slicing. It is coupled with real-life case studies to illustrate its applications in different sectors from Healthcare to Advanced Manufacturing to Retail that is deployed at the APEX 5G Centre in Nanyang Polytechnic. It will also include MEC platform solutions. Participants will have a better understanding of 5G and the benefits it will bring to various industries.
