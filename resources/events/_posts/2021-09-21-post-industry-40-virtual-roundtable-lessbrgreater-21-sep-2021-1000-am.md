# About the Event
Industry 4.0 is revolutionizing the way companies manufacture, improve and distribute their products. Manufacturers are integrating enabling technologies, including Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing and analytics, AI and machine learning into their production facilities and throughout their operations.

Coupled with the emergence of 5G technology, this presents an enormous opportunity for enterprises to drive new values and transform their operations to harness the next era of industrial connectivity. This allows for increasing automation and the employment of smart factories informed by data to produce goods more efficiently and productively.

In this virtual workshop, IBM will demonstrate how we could put advanced AI technology to work. Utilizing technology like Visual Insights, Augmented Reality, Quality Analytics, Acoustic AI, Edge Computing and 5G, we demonstrate real life applications of these technology in an industrial setting as well as other applications beyond the industrial space. It is crucial that industrial companies have an opportunity to test and evaluate these technological investments, and IBM is committed to working shoulder to shoulder with them, to ensure they make the best decisions that will truly propel their business forward.

Who needs to join: Chief Transformation Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Information Officer, Head of Automations, Director of Engineering, Director of Quality Assurance and their related departments.
